The current script.py and metrics.py are functional on the LOLv2 real dataset.
To train and sample the model for LOLv2 synthetic the only change that is needed is the path to the datasets and where the model is being saved.
Change the dataset paths 

to:
datasets/LOL-v2/Synthetic

from:
datasets/LOL-v2/Real_captured

everywhere necessary.
